# Examples

## Example 1

Unix-way is so nice [@unix_philosophy].

![Image (figure) of something](img/example_asd.png)

```{language=bash caption="Code of something"}
alias ls="ls -l"
```

### List of something

1. So.
2. Much.
3. Items.

You can also write tex code right here, like \newline or

\clearpage

`pandoc` by default just passes them to tex as raw text, so later tex compiler
processes them.
